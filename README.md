## Weatherman Joe Webapp

##### Information
This project is based off the many thousand apps for weather information.  Through use of the OpenWeather API, I am able to create an average temperature for 5 days and also check for the min and max temperatures for each day.  The project is also responsive for three different types of screens.

##### Bugs and Extras
Lacks aggregateD icon needs to be improved.
There are several features that I would like to add such as country codes, rainfall, humidity, and pressure readings but this is only extra as the task was to create an aggregate temperature from given data.
